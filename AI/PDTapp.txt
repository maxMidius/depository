Can we create a marimo notebook which will declare the above structures as three dataframes  and link them into a tree structure like so
Project (1) --> Deliverables(n)
Deliverable(1)  --> Tasks (n)
The minimal  marimo app should allow user to enter/edit/delete new data for the following fields:
Project -->  ShortId, Brief, Type,  Tags
Deliverable --> ShortId, Brief, Tags
Task -->  ShortId, Brief,  Task_Team, Effort
